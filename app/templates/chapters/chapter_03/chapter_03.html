          <sub style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; color:#FF3B30;">S</sub>uppose you have two
          numbers or pieces of information, like apples and oranges. Comparison operators in Python
          are like tools you can use to compare these numbers or pieces of information to see how they
          relate to each other. Here are some of the main comparison operators:
        </p>
        <br>

        <strong>
          &bull; Equal to: <a href="python.org" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; color:#FF3B30;">==</a>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Variables are like labeled containers. Within these containers we place our information to
          be used for later use. The information placed in these containers can be numbers, words, and
          lists of things, just like how you might have separate boxes for your shoes, clothes, and
          books. Each container holds a specific type of information, making it easier for the
          computer to understand what we're working with.

          The image above displays two variables. A variable called name with the information of
          someone named Julia, and a variable called age with someone's age as 10.

        <strong>
          &bull; What are strings and integers?
        </strong>
        <p>
          Did you Notice â€œJulia" is in quotes and our number / integer is not? That's because strings
          are represented as quotes. Think of strings like colored beads placed on a string necklace.
          Each bead represents a letter or a symbol, while integers are plain number blocks used for
          counting and math.

          called <a href="#" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; color:#FF3B30;">print</a>.
